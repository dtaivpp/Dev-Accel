# Dev Accel

We are an open source website written in Clojure and Clojure script aimed at building up new developers through mentorship and meaningful experience. 

### General Idea

Starting out as a new or self taught developer can be very difficult. Everyone reccomends contributing to some open source project but that can be hard if you don't know where to start. In steps Dev-Accel. We connect new developers with a basic knowledge of coding to a mentor. 

In these groups they will gain experience through collaberatively contributing to open source. 

### How to Help

Currently we are looking for anyone interested to help us create our service. We meet on discord https://discord.gg/xQrnR9w to do all of our planning.
